## Taster

A quick first look at Media Server.  Watch a demonstration video where Media Server's training GUI is used to quickly configure custom alert rules for a fun video.

[Watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wl-uYCADreo&list=PLlUdEXI83_Xoq5Fe2iUnY8fjV9PuX61FA).

## Getting started

### Minimum requirements

- 2 cores, 4 GB RAM and 20GB free disk space.
- 64-bit Windows or Linux (this guide has been most recently tested on Windows 10 and Ubuntu 18.10).
- A text editor.
- Administrator privileges to install software.
- A webcam.

> NOTE: Sizing Media Server for your own production tasks depends greatly on your use case, as discussed [later in these tutorials](showcase/face-recognition/README.md#hardware-requirements).

### Setup IDOL Media Server

> NOTE: Do this before starting any tutorials.

Follow [these steps](setup/SETUP.md) to install IDOL Media Server and get ready to run the tutorials.

## Introduction

> NOTE: Everyone should do this tutorial.

Make a serious start with rich media analytics, using face analytics as our guiding example.  This end-to-end course takes you from your first Media Server configuration to running your own app, which makes use of Media Server as an analytics service.  All you need is a webcam (and a few hours of your time)!

[Get started](introduction/README.md).

## Analytics showcase examples

> NOTE: These guides assume some familiarity with Media Server concepts.

Dip into any of the following showcase guides to try more analytics.

[Get started](showcase/README.md).

## Further reading

### Example configurations

Many more example analysis configurations are provided with your Media Server installation, under `configurations/examples`.  Now you know your Media Server, you can use these as inspiration for our own use cases!

### Media Server for OEM
