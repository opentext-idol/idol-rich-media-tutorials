## General interest

### Face Recognition

Train and match faces from image and video. Discussion on how to tune your configuration for real-world performance.

Start [here](./face-recognition/README.md).

### Face Clustering

Automatically organize unsorted pictures of people into unique identities using Face Recognition clustering.

[Watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlnAqKKrQYw&list=PLlUdEXI83_Xoq5Fe2iUnY8fjV9PuX61FA).

<!-- TODO: Add lesson. -->

### Image Classification

Classify any image using a pre-trained classifier, then create your own classifier to differentiate between different types of image content.

[Get started](./image-classification/README.md).

### Object Class Recognition

Detect and locate objects from 80 pre-defined classes in images using a pre-trained recognizer, then create your own recognizer to detect different types of objects.

[Get started](./object-class-recognition/README.md).

### Optical Character Recognition

Use OCR to detect and transcribe text found in images in over 45 languages and scripts, preserving table data structure.  Extract more than just text: match logos, read barcodes and use pre-trained models to visually classify documents.  Follow scrolling news from a video clip to capture the latest headlines.

[Get started](./optical-character-recognition/README.md).

## Focus on CCTV analytics

### Surveillance alerting

Process CCTV video to track people and vehicles.  Learn how to use Knowledge Discovery Media Server's GUI to easily configure scenario-based alerts to capture events such as loitering, wrong way driving and illegal turning.  Let's keep the roads safe!

[Get started](./surveillance/README.md).

### Person analysis

Detect people and perform additional visual analytics to label clothing type and color, head covering and more.

> COMING SOON!

### Vehicle analysis

Read numberplates (licenseplates) and perform additional vehicle analytics to identify the make and color.

[Get started](./vehicle-analysis/README.md).

### VMS integration with Milestone

Integrate Knowledge Discovery Media Server as an analytics "plug-in" for the Milestone XProtect video management system.  Set up a trial version of Milestone XProtect Corporate (in case you don't already have one), then learn how to ingest video from it and send alert results back for viewing.

[Get started](./milestone-integration/README.md).

## Focus on broadcast monitoring

### Speech Transcription

Process audio to transcribe human speech from a news broadcast. Search those speech transcripts to understand what's being reported on without having to watch TV!

[Get started](./speech-transcription/README.md).

### Logo Recognition

Find and track logos in broadcast video from a football/soccer match.

[Get started](./logo-recognition/README.md).

## Focus on document processing

### ID card reading

Process a scanned image of an ID card to extract useful structured information.

[Get started](./id-card-ocr/README.md).

## Next steps

Please come back soon for more tutorials in the near future!

For now, please return to the [main page](../README.md#further-reading) for further reading.
