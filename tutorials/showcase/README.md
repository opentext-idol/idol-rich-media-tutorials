## Face recognition

Train and match faces from image and video. Discussion on how to tune your configuration for real-world performance.

Start [here](./face-recognition/README.md).

## Face Clustering

Automatically organize unsorted pictures of people into unique identities using Face Recognition clustering.

[Watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlnAqKKrQYw&list=PLlUdEXI83_Xoq5Fe2iUnY8fjV9PuX61FA).

## Surveillance analytics

Process CCTV video to track people and vehicles.  Learn how to use Media Server's GUI to easily configure scenario-based alerts to capture events such as loitering, wrong way driving and illegal turning.  Let's keep the roads safe!

[Get started](./surveillance/README.md).

## Vehicle analysis

Read number/license places.  Perform additional vehicle analytics to identify the make and color.

[Get started](./vehicle-analysis/README.md).

## Milestone VMS integration

Integrate Media Server as an analytics "plug-in" for the Milestone XProtect video management system.  Set up a trial version of Milestone XProtect Corporate (in case you don't already have one), then learn how to ingest video from it and send alert results back for viewing.

[Get started](./milestone-integration/README.md).

## Speech transcription

Process audio to transcribe human speech from a news broadcast. Search those speech transcripts to understand what's being reported on without having to watch TV!

[Get started](./speech-transcription/README.md).

## Optical Character Recognition

Use OCR to detect and transcribe text found in images in over 45 languages and scripts, preserving table data structure.  Follow scrolling news from a video clip to capture the latest headlines.

[Get started](./optical-character-recognition/README.md).

## Logo recognition

Find and track logos in broadcast video from a football/soccer match.

[Get started](./logo-recognition/README.md).

## Image classification

Classify any image using the pre-trained ImageNet classifier.

[Get started](./image-classification/README.md).

## Object class recognition

Detect and locate objects from 80 pre-defined classes in images using a pre-trained recognizer.

[Get started](./object-class-recognition/README.md).

## ID card reading

Process a scanned image of an ID card to extract useful structured information.

[Get started](./id-card-ocr/README.md).

## Next steps

Please come back soon for more tutorials in the near future!
